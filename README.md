## Developing

To run the project locally, you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) version 20 or newer, and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| `pnpm install`            | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`                | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`              | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`            | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
