Python is a programming language.

A programming language is a language you can use to describe what you want the computer to do. These scripts or 'programs' range from simple addition to a series of yes/no operations to complicated mathematics, to websites, to statistics, and through to video games and machine learning. 

Like human (or *natural*) languages, a programming language has a series of words, phrases, syntax, and grammar. Some programming languages are very different to others, while others share a lot of syntax and structures. If you're a linguist, you can think of this as akin to family trees. If you know French, it'll be easier to pick up Spanish or Italian. Likewise, if you know C++, it'll be easier to understand Rust or C.

Python is well known for two characteristics; how 'easy' (relatively!) it is for humans to read and write, and how powerful it is for different types of computing. Python is therefore incredibly popular. Since it's incredibly popular for many different tasks, its users have made packages for common types of tasks. You might have heard of Django, which is a web framework (a collection of packages bundled together to make building and hosting websites easier), Numpy, which is a library of mathematical tools, or Scipy, which is for scientific computing. 

Python's popularity and vibrant community of users and libraries are useful to save time programming. Since a computer can only do what a program describes, using others' python code shared in this way means you don't need to spend time writing complicated code to tell the computer how to, say, interpret an excel file, load that data into a new structure, and then do statistical modelling. 

Python, then, is an easy-to-read programming language that can be used to write programs, which are sets of instructions for the computer. This leaves out how a programming language is converted in turn to the *machine* code that instructs the processor on a physical level. You don't need to know that in order to begin to write python.

Why use Python?

We know, then, that we can write instructions for a computer and that python is an incredibly popular means of writing those scripts or programs. A computer can deal with these instructions extremely quickly. A lot of people have written lots of programs in python for decades, which means that you can use these programs to quickly do calculations that would take years, decades, or centuries by hand.

But you aren't a mathematician or scientist. Let's say you're a historian. Perhaps you're even a classicist, geographer, archaeologist, or philosopher, more likely to think in terms of manuscripts, letters, maps, or material culture such as paintings, sculptures, houses, ruins, than calculus.

What python offers you is a efficient way to both organise your material and get new information out of it. In short, to do cool *stuff* without the laborious tasks. You saw perhaps recently how students managed to 'read' (reconstruct) a carbonised scroll that had been recovered from a villa at Herculaneum. They did this by taking 2d slices from a scan of the scroll, then using machine learning in python to reproduce letters, sentences, and full paragraphs from what looks like charcoal. To do this, they didn't need to rewrite all the software ab initio; they could build on the wealth of existing work by mathematicians, statisticians, and physicists in order to derive novel information from the classical world. This is at the bleeding edge of machine learning. 

Even for basic archival work, making a database of thousands of letters and producing a visualisation of the correspondence network is trivial. You could write a program that in one line takes a photo from your desk top, and in another few lines reads that file, identifies the letters, and transcribes them into a text file. Once the program is written, it can do the same with thousands of files in a blink of an eye. 

The strength of Python is that it makes it simple to do lots of intensive or boring tasks quickly, and then chain these tasks together to find patterns.
