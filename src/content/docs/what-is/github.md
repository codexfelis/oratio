[GitHub](https://github.com) is a website where open-source code is build and shared. Think of code here in the loosest sense - smallish data sets in text files or spreadsheets, your thesis in a Markdown file, anything that is sort of vaguely text-based can happily live on GitHub. 


## Why should I care?

### Finding other people's code

### Using issues for feedback

### Sharing my own code, writing or data

## Are there alternatives?

Yep, if you don't want to use GitHub for your own stuff for whatever reason, there's quite a few alternatives. The closest in terms of features are GitLab and Bitbucket.
