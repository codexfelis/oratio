## Article type

This is a conceptual article (what is...) / concrete article (how do I...) - delete as applicable

The title should be something like:  ... (set this as the issue title too please!)

## Target audience

What do people reading this article already need to know about, what background knowledge do they need, in terms of technical or domain concepts?

What problem is the person reading this trying to solve in their research? Try to think of a concrete example situation why someone would need to know about/how to do this thing

## Things to cover

What points does this article need to touch on? Are there a series of steps to outline? Write them here

## Is it related to anything else we've written about?

If you can, point to things we've written about (or are planning) that are useful as prerequisites for this article, or as follow-up. 

## Anything else?

Anything else we should know? Do you have links to anywhere on social media/blogs of people asking about this topic? Do you have links to relevant/further reading?

## Next steps

Would you prefer:

- [ ] I want to write the article mostly myself
- [ ] I would like you to write about this for me

In either case, the next step is to wait for Dan or Caro to read the proposal and check it's something we want to include, then we'll take a branch and start working on an outline together. Thanks for your contribution ðŸŽ‰
